    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Digital Curation Policy Plan is to outline the principles and guidelines for curating a Sámi-American collection in a digital space. The collection aims to preserve, promote, and share the rich cultural heritage and history of the Sámi people in America. This policy plan addresses key considerations, including legal requirements, technological obsolescence, and shifts in intellectual property concepts, to ensure the long-term accessibility and relevance of the digital archive.</p>

    <h2>Legal Requirements</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for Legal Requirements section -->
    <p>A key consideration for any digital archive is the legal requirements surrounding data privacy and protection. At the one-year mark, the Siida digital archive must review its policies to ensure compliance with any new legal requirements that have arisen. This may include updating policies related to data encryption, access controls, and user privacy. Failure to do so could result in the archive being in violation of legal requirements, leading to reputational damage and legal consequences. We, as a collaborating team, will ensure that our digital curation policy remains compliant with all relevant legal requirements in the United States as well as in Scandinavia by consulting with lawyers specializing fields of intellectual property law or technology law, more specifically privacy law, copyright law, and digital media law.</p>

    <h2>Technological Obsolescence</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for Technological Obsolescence section -->
    <p>Technological obsolescence is another consideration that must be accounted for in the curation policy. At the one-year mark, the archive will review its technological infrastructure to ensure that it remains current and effective. This may include upgrading hardware, updating software, and improving the user interface to ensure that the platform remains accessible and user-friendly. Of course, this effort will need to be funded through constant application and occasion award of grants and government funding. However, failure to do so could result in the platform becoming obsolete, rendering the information contained within it inaccessible to future generations which defeats the purpose and the important mission of such a project. We will monitor our technological tools to ensure that they remain up-to-date and effective with our own talent and resources. </p>

    <section class="container">
    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for Intellectual Property section -->
    <p>Intellectual property is also a crucial aspect of any digital archive. The archive must be transparent about ownership and attribution of cultural artifacts and must develop policies that protect the intellectual property rights of both individuals and institutions. At the one-year mark, the archive must review its policies to ensure that they are in line with any shifts in individual or institutional attitudes towards the sharing and ownership of cultural artifacts. This may include updating policies related to copyright, fair use, and the public domain. We will monitor shifts in concepts of intellectual property at the individual and institutional level and adjust our policy as needed in consultation with the previously mentioned lawyers.
        At the five-year mark, the Sámi American archive must conduct a comprehensive review of its curation policies to evaluate their effectiveness. This review must include an assessment of the archive's compliance with any new legal requirements, an evaluation of the archive's technological infrastructure to address any potential issues with obsolescence, and a review of the archive's intellectual property policies to ensure that they align with any shifts in individual or institutional attitudes towards intellectual property. The review must also include an assessment of the archive's user engagement metrics to determine the effectiveness of the platform's outreach efforts.
        One of the most important considerations for any digital archive is user engagement. The archive must also evaluate its outreach efforts to ensure that the platform is reaching its target audience effectively. This may include reviewing social media engagement metrics, evaluating the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and assessing user feedback to identify areas for improvement. Lastly, the archive will need to reconsider the impact of cultural shifts on user engagement and adapt its policies accordingly.
        Finally, at the ten-year mark, the archive must take stock of its achievements and consider any necessary improvements to its curation policies. This may include conducting a thorough review of its legal compliance, technological infrastructure, intellectual property policies, and user engagement metrics. The archive must also prioritize the long-term preservation of its digital assets by considering the most up-to-date methods for data storage and backup. Additionally, the archive must consider any significant shifts in cultural attitudes and adapt its policies accordingly to remain relevant and effective.

    <h2>Collection Development</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for Collection Development section -->
      <p>The Sámi American digital archive or Saiida aims to preserve data-based digital resources. Digital resource types accepted by the Saiida project include, but are not limited to: 
        -  Text documents (plain and marked-up) 
        -  Still Image collections 
        - Physical heritage items transformed into 3d images
        -  Datasets (data designed for use in spreadsheets, databases, and statistical packages) 
        -  Digital audio recordings 
        -  Digital moving image recordings 
        -  GIS 
        -  Virtual reality 
        -  Websites 
    
        We will periodically review our digital content to determine which materials should be retained and preserved for future use. By being in constant communication with the Sámi American community, we hope to ensure the selection process remains lead by the communities’ cultural values and beliefs. One way we can conduct appraisals one a tile or item has been digitized and archived on the online platform is by programing periodical verification of the files through a checksum. A checksum is a value that is generated based on the contents of the file, and it can be used to verify that the file has not been altered in any way.

    <h2>Metadata and Documentation</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for Metadata and Documentation section -->
     <p>We will create and maintain detailed documentation and metadata for our digital content to ensure that it remains understandable and accessible over time. Metadata that is coded to prevent encroachment on any individuals PII will be stored on hard drive disks and kept with a select number of administrators with proper respect given to PII of others. </p>

    <section class="container">
    <h2>User Access and Engagement</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for User Access and Engagement section -->
    <p>We will ensure that our digital content remains accessible to users, regardless of their geographic location, and that it is available in formats that are appropriate for the intended use. However as with many but not all indigenous communities, access will be decided based on cultural values, in this case, the Sámi American perspective of ownership and access based on their societal systems in collaboration with myself and other advising data curation and MILS professional allies. </p>

    <section class="container">
    <h2>Review and Evaluation</h2>
      <!-- Policy plan content for Review and Evaluation section -->
      <p>Our digital curation policy will be a living document that is periodically reviewed and updated as needed. Changes to the policy can be proposed by any member of the organization and will be reviewed by a designated committee made up of live long MILS learners and respected and appointed Sámi American community members. Once a proposed change has been approved, it will be added to the policy and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
        To measure the success of our digital curation policy, we will use the following metrics: We will aim to preserve at least 90% of our digital content. We are also striving to provide user satisfaction where we will survey Sámi American community users to gauge their satisfaction with the accessibility and usability of our digital content. We will create a separate survey for the general public based on the approval of the Sámi American community representatives. These surveys will be taken to a scheduled meeting with the elected committee and discussed in-depth to aid in the shaping of our improvement strategies.
